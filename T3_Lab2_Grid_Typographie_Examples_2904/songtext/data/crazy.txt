I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there
Without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly
Come on now
Who do you
Who do you, who do you
Who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?
My heroes had the heart
To lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin'
I wanna be like them
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
Maybe I'm crazy
